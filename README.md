# CRM-Data

In this case study, I employed data processing techniques to standardize and validate customer phone numbers, enhancing the efficiency of our customer support system. I also conducted an in-depth analysis of email communication patterns across different customer segments, providing visual insights and strategic recommendations to optimize CRM communications. This holistic approach aimed to improve engagement and responsiveness, tailored to each unique segment's behavior and preferences.
